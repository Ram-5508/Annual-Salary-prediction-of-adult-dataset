# Annual-Salary-prediction-of-adult-dataset

Prediction task is to determine whether a person makes over 50K a year.

The dataset is taken from this link :https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Adult

THe dataset contains around 4000 missing values. I have filled all the missing values.

This is a probabilistic based prediction model, so we can either Logistic regression, Naive baye's , random forest or Gradient boosting. I have used Gradient boosting algorith because it will work again on the error values and gives more accurate prediction.
