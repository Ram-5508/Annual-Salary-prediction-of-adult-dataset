# Annual-Salary-prediction-of-adult-dataset

Prediction task is to determine whether a person makes over 50K a year.

The dataset is taken from this link :https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Adult

The dataset contains around 4000 missing values. I have filled all the missing values.

This is a probabilistic based prediction model, so we can either Logistic regression, Naive baye's , random forest or Gradient boosting. I have used Gradient boosting algorithm because it  gives more accurate prediction.

I have also done classification report, confusion matrix and ROC curve to check the accuracy of prediction.
